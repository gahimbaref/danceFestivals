            Creating a digital project that explores the cultural significance of dance festivals and their role in fostering cosmopolitanism has been a thought-provoking journey. In this artist statement, I will delve into the origins and evolution of this project, its underlying conceptual framework, the creative process involved in its development, the technical aspects of the interactive map, and the overarching goal of promoting cosmopolitanism through dance. This extensive exploration will be divided into several sections to provide a comprehensive understanding of the project's background, significance, and execution.
     
            <br>
            <h2>Section 1: Introduction and background</h2>
            As a student and dancer, I embarked on this project with the goal of celebrating the beauty of diversity, and the role of dance festivals in promoting cosmopolitanism. Dance can be seen as a universal language that transcends borders, languages, and cultures. It has the remarkable ability to bring people together, fostering an appreciation for various cultures and traditions. Dance festivals, in particular, act as an opportunity to showcase the world's rich tapestry of dance forms, music, and customs, making them ideal platforms for the exploration of cosmopolitanism.
            Growing up in Burundi, I quickly came to realize the profound significance of dance within my culture. Dance was not just a form of artistic expression; it was an integral part of our heritage and identity. From a young age, I observed how dance performances held a central role in the fabric of our society, gracing the most momentous occasions. Whether it was the celebrations of weddings, cultural events , or even national ceremonies, dance and the rhythmic beats of drums stood at the forefront of our cultural expressions. These vibrant and dynamic performances wove together the threads of our history and traditions, serving as a testament to the resilience and unity of our people. This early exposure to the profound role of dance in my community left an indelible mark on my dancing journey, motivating me to explore the universal language of dance and its potential to bridge cultures and foster understanding on a global scale as a research project.
            My journey with dance took an unexpected turn when my father, who had already settled in the United States before the rest of my family joined him, would often tell my sister and I that we would perform at my own welcoming party once we arrived. 
            <br>
            <br>

            Initially, I didn't quite grasp the significance of this idea, but as I settled into my new life in the States, the role of dance became abundantly clear. It became a conduit through which I connected with my culture, preserved my heritage, and forged a sense of belonging in a foreign land. As people started calling us to dance at their weddings, engagements, and other cultural events, I began to understand the immense power of this art form. These opportunities not only allowed me to share the beauty of my culture but also served as a bridge, helping me adapt to a new world as an immigrant. Dance, in its universal language, brought me closer to people from various backgrounds, enabling me to communicate, connect, and find my place in this richly diverse country. An audience comment on my dance performance, has often lead to a meaningful conversation, which shows how dance serve as an ice breaker to conversation among strangers. 
            Kentucky Refugee Ministries, the organization that welcomed my family in the United States, often used to invite my sister and I to dance to for concerts, festivals such as Worldfest and African American Heritage Festival in Louisville, KY, as well as other cultural events. Looking back now, I didn’t fully appreciate the role that festivals play in bringing people together but after doing my research, I realize that they are like a quick introduction to different cultures.
            Dance festivals are a great way to not only preserve and share culture but to connect people of various backgrounds. As I continue to dig deeper into my research, I have realized that there are some cultural and political issues within dance festivals, like some cultural dances not being recognized as a form of art and how those issues might be reflected in who performs in dance festivals which I hope to highlight in my digital project.
            <br>

            <h2> Section 2: The Conceptual Framework</h2>
            To understand the significance of this project, it's essential to explore the concept of cosmopolitanism. Cosmopolitanism is a philosophy that advocates the idea that all human beings are part of a single community, and individuals should embrace a global perspective while respecting and celebrating cultural differences. Dance festivals are a manifestation of this idea. They provide a stage where people from different parts of the world come together to celebrate their cultural identities while appreciating the uniqueness of others. My project aims to demonstrate how dance festivals can be microcosms of cosmopolitanism, fostering cross-cultural understanding and unity, why acknowledging some of the fundamental issues in dance festivals that might contradict its purpose. 
            <br>

            <h2> Section 3: The Creative Process</h2>
            The creative process behind this project involved a combination of research, design, and technical implementation. 
            Originally, I planned to focus on the following research question: What are the fundamental elements of dance that transcend cultural boundaries and enable it to serve as a universal language of expression and communication? As I was discussing my research question with my professor, he brought up some of the complications that might be associated with the idea of dance being a universal language, especially when the meaning can be lost in interpretations. As a result, I decided to talk to some of my friends who are also dancers, some of whom we share a dance group such as the African Student Association dance club on my campus and I came to realize that the audience’s interpretation of their dance is not as important as them appreciating the art involved in their dances. Most dancers that I talked to are originally from different countries, and most of them seemed to agree on the fact that when they perform their cultural dances, they want their dance to be seen and appreciated which is one of the reasons I decided to focus on dance festivals as dance festivals are a great places for cultural dances to be seen as millions of people travel just to see the performances
            To start, I conducted a research on various dance forms, festivals, and their historical and cultural backgrounds. I explored the history of dance festivals in different parts of the world, their rituals, costumes, and the role they play in the communities they originate from.
            With a rich understanding of the subject matter, I began the design phase. I wanted to create an interactive experience that would immerse users in the world of dance festivals. To do this, I designed an interactive map. The map features dots representing different dance festivals around the world. When a user clicks on a dot, they are presented with a comprehensive description of the festival, including its cultural significance, history, and the unique dance forms it showcases, as well as any issues that might be associated with it.
           
            
            <h2>            Section 4: The Technical Aspects
            </h2>
            The technical implementation of this project was a crucial aspect of making the concept come to life. The map is not only visually engaging but also user-friendly, making it accessible to a wide audience.
            The descriptions of each dance festival will be accompanied by multimedia elements, such as images, videos, and audio clips, to provide a rich and immersive experience. Users can truly feel the rhythm, see the vibrant costumes, and hear the music that accompanies each dance form. These technical details will be instrumental in bringing the project to life and making it an engaging and informative experience.
            Section 5: Promoting Cosmopolitanism Through Dance Festivals
            The ultimate goal of this project is to highlight how dance festivals can play a pivotal role in promoting cosmopolitanism despite their imperfections. By showcasing these festivals from various corners of the world, I aim to bring awareness and foster an appreciation for the diversity of human expression and cultural traditions. Through this interactive map, users can virtually travel to different countries, learn about their dance forms, and gain insights into the cultural and historical contexts that shape them. These festivals have the power to break down stereotypes, reduce prejudices, and build connections across borders. They create spaces where people from diverse backgrounds can come together in celebration and harmony.
            Furthermore, this project underscores the idea that cosmopolitanism is not about erasing differences but about celebrating them. It encourages us to see the beauty in the mosaic of cultures that make up our world. In a time when divisions and misunderstandings are prevalent, the celebration of diversity through dance festivals becomes an essential vehicle for promoting a more inclusive and interconnected world.
            I invite you to explore this digital project, embark on a virtual journey through the world of dance festivals, and, in doing so, join in the celebration of cosmopolitanism through the universal language of dance. Thank you for your interest and support in this artistic endeavor.
