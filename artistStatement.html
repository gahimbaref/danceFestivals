            <h2> Description</h2>
        
        Dance festivals serve as portals, offering glimpses into diverse cultures, fostering connections, and illuminating the essence of cosmopolitanism through the exchange of traditions, stories, and emotions. They are vibrant reflections of a world striving for unity amid diversity, encapsulating the spirit of interconnectedness that transcends geographical boundaries. However, my digital map also sheds light on the complex challenges that confront cosmopolitanism. Amidst the celebration of cultural exchange, there exist instances where dance festivals have become arenas for political tensions or reflect the issues that arise when different cultures try to converge. These instances, while fostering dialogue, also highlight the inherent obstacles to achieving genuine cosmopolitanism.

        Through this project, I aim to acknowledge these challenges by presenting diverse dance festivals worldwide. Some of these festivals will be showcased not just for their artistic brilliance but also to unravel the intricate layers of controversy and discomfort that marred their narratives. These incidents serve as stark reminders that while dance festivals can be catalysts for unity, they also mirror the ongoing struggle against cultural insensitivity and appropriation.
        <br>
        <br>
        In essence, this digital dance festival map endeavors to celebrate the beauty of diversity while acknowledging the complexities that hinder the realization of true cosmopolitanism. By engaging with both the celebratory and challenging aspects of these festivals, we invite reflection, dialogue, and a deeper understanding of the intricate interplay between cultural exchange and the obstacles that impede its harmonious manifestation.

            <h2>Personal Background and Significance</h2>
            As a student and dancer, I embarked on this project with the goal of celebrating the beauty of diversity, and the role of dance festivals in promoting cosmopolitanism. Dance can be seen as a universal language that transcends borders, languages, and cultures. It has the remarkable ability to bring people together, fostering an appreciation for various cultures and traditions. Dance festivals, in particular, act as an opportunity to showcase the world's rich tapestry of dance forms, music, and customs, making them ideal platforms for the exploration of cosmopolitanism.

            <br>
            <br>
            Growing up in Burundi, I quickly came to realize the profound significance of dance within my culture. Dance was not just a form of artistic expression; it was an integral part of our heritage and identity. From a young age, I observed how dance performances held a central role in the fabric of our society, gracing the most momentous occasions. Whether it was the celebrations of weddings, cultural events, or even national ceremonies, dance and the rhythmic beats of drums stood at the forefront of our cultural expressions. These vibrant and dynamic performances wove together the threads of our history and traditions, serving as a testament to the resilience and unity of our people. This early exposure to the profound role of dance in my community left an indelible mark on my dancing journey, motivating me to explore the universal language of dance and its potential to bridge cultures and foster understanding on a global scale as a research project.
            <br>
            <br>
            My journey with dance took an unexpected turn when my father, who had already settled in the United States before the rest of my family joined him, would often tell my sister and I that we would perform at our own welcoming party once we arrived. Initially, I didn't quite grasp the significance of this idea, but as I settled into my new life in the States, the role of dance became abundantly clear. It became a conduit through which I connected with my culture, preserved my heritage, and forged a sense of belonging in a foreign land. As people started calling us to dance at their weddings, engagements, and other cultural events, I began to understand the immense power of this art form. These opportunities not only allowed me to share the beauty of my culture but also served as a bridge, helping me adapt to a new world as an immigrant. Dance, in its universal language, brought me closer to people from various backgrounds, enabling me to communicate, connect, and find my place in this richly diverse country. An audience comment on my dance performance, has often lead to a meaningful conversation, which shows how dance can serve as an ice breaker to conversation among strangers. As a result, I decided to combine my passion for dance and my research on cosmopolitanism to create a digital dance map that captures both.

            <h2> Creative Process and Technical Aspects</h2>
            The creative process behind this project involved a combination of research, design, and technical implementation. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Originally, I planned to focus on the following research question: What are the fundamental elements of dance that transcend cultural boundaries and enable it to serve as a universal language of expression and communication? As I was discussing my research question with my professor, he brought up some of the complications that might be associated with the idea of dance being a universal language, especially when the meaning can be lost in interpretations. As a result, I decided to talk to some of my friends who are also dancers, some of whom we share a dance group such as the African Student Association dance club on my campus and I came to realize that the audienceâ€™s interpretation of their dance is not as important as them appreciating the art involved in their dances. Most dancers that I talked to are originally from different countries, and most of them seemed to agree on the fact that when they perform their cultural dances, they want their dance to be seen and appreciated which is one of the reasons I decided to focus on dance festivals or cultural festivals that involve dance as these places are great for cultural exchange as millions of people travel just to see the performances.
            <br>
            <br>
            To start, I conducted a research on various dance forms, festivals, and their historical and cultural backgrounds. I explored the history of dance festivals in different parts of the world and the role they play in the communities they originate from but also on a global scale. I noticed that most current festivals are promoted as great places to bring people together but there is no scholarship that dives deep into their role in fostering cosmopolitanism nor any challenges they present. As a result, I looked into dance festivals that occurred in the 1900s. The scholarship on these festivals presented a different perspective, especially as the festivals were likely to be politically motivated. I decided to include these festivals because they were a good reflection of the cosmopolitan issues we face today. They offered a more realistic view of challenges that come to surface when you converge different cultures.
            <br>
            <br>
            I then began the design phase. I wanted to create an interactive experience that would immerse users in the world of dance festivals. To do this, I designed an interactive map. The map features dots representing different dance festivals around the world with a color key as to what each color represents. Green for national festivals, red for international festivals with political challenges, blue for international festivals with cultural challenges, and yellow for festivals that I believe are successful in bringing people together, and exemplify cosmopolitanism. When a user clicks on a dot, they are presented with a comprehensive description and analysis of the festival.
            <br>
            <br>
            I invite you to explore this digital project, embark on a virtual journey through the world of dance festivals, and, in doing so, join in the celebration of cosmopolitanism through the universal language of dance. Thank you for your interest in this artistic endeavor.
