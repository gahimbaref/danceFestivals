            The 1936 dance tournament/festival in Berlin represents a distorted and manipulated version of cosmopolitanism. It reveals how the event was used to serve political agendas, selectively included or excluded participants, repressed artistic expression, and struggled to authentically celebrate and understand diverse cultures. This mirrors the inherent challenges and contradictions within the concept of cosmopolitanism, exposing its limitations when confronted with political ideologies and oppressive regimes.
            <br><br>
            The 1936 Berlin Olympics and the international dance festival shared a context deeply intertwined with the political landscape of Nazi Germany. Both events were orchestrated by the Nazi regime as propaganda tools to promote their ideology of Aryan supremacy, while simultaneously projecting an image of internationalism and cultural exchange.
            <br><br>

            The Berlin Olympics of 1936, officially known as the Games of the XI Olympiad, were a significant moment for Nazi Germany. Adolf Hitler and the Nazis saw the Olympics as an opportunity to showcase their vision of a revitalized, powerful Germany to the world. They used the Games as a stage to display Nazi propaganda, attempting to demonstrate German superiority in athletics and present Berlin as a modern, tolerant city.
            <br><br>

            Despite international calls for a boycott due to the Nazi regime's discriminatory policies, many countries participated in the Games. Athletes from various nations competed, symbolizing a global gathering on the surface. However, beneath this facade of international sportsmanship, the Nazis sought to utilize the Olympics as a tool for their political agenda, attempting to validate their racial ideologies through athletic success.
            <br><br>

            Similarly, the international dance festival held in Berlin around the same time as the Olympics aimed to present an illusion of cultural diversity and international cooperation. with invitations extended to all nations participating in the Games, dancers and performers from different countries participated, showcasing a variety of dance forms and cultural expressions. However, similar to the Olympics, the festival occurred within the framework of Nazi control and was used to propagate the regime's false narrative of cultural openness.
            <br><br>

            Amidst this backdrop, the United States did not join as Martha Graham, a prominent American dancer, declined the invitation to perform in Germany, encapsulating the ethical dilemma faced by artists of conscience during that time. She stated that she finds it impossible to dance in Germany at that time especially considering the fact that some of her dance members were jews and would not be welcomed. Her words reflected a principled stand against the oppressive regime and its persecution of artists. Graham's refusal highlighted the moral dilemma of associating oneself with a regime responsible for the repression and exclusion of talented individuals, while also underscoring the ethical responsibilities of artists to take a stand against injustice.
            <br><br>

            Participation in both the Olympics and the dance festival mirrored the complexities of the time. While athletes and artists from various nations took part, the events were manipulated by the Nazi regime to serve their propaganda purposes. Many nations' participation was often seen as a tacit acceptance of the Nazi regime or a deliberate attempt to avoid potential political controversies.
            <br><br>

            In essence, both the 1936 Berlin Olympics and the international dance festival were instances where the Nazis exploited international gatherings to further their political agenda and present a deceptive image of tolerance and internationalism while concealing their discriminatory ideologies and practices.
